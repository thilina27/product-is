WSO2 Identity Server ${product.version}
==========================

Welcome to the WSO2 Identity Server ${product.version} release.

WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Entitlement management server. It supports a wide array of authentication 
protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive. 
It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is 
supported through SCIM and SPML.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.

New Features
============

*  In cases where users will have multiple entries in their respective user stores, to avoid requiring multiple

     logins to an application to obtain a fully privileged view for a single user's details, we now support merging
     of multiple user profiles.

*  Workflow Support for Identity Server

     WSO2 IS ${product.version} now supports user store operations to engage with workflows. Administrators will be able select
     at which levels each operation should be approved before they get executed. This will be available as a
     optional feature where administrator will be able to select if to use them on their user store operations or not.

* FIDO Authentication

     FIDO(Fast IDentity Online) will provide an extra layer of security to your account.  FIDO protocols use standard
     public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication. WSO2 IS ${product.version} now supports FIDO
     authentication.


*  XACML cache invalidation notification when changes are made to Identities

     WSO2 IS ${product.version} is now able to send invalidation notifications to external endpoints when there is a change in user
     roles, permissions or attributes as well as clear the internal cache when user roles, permissions or attributes
     been updated

*  PATCH operation support for SCIM 1.1

     PUT supports the replace operation but not the update operation. Since group is a heavy resource, the
     operation that alters without replacement (PATCH) needs to be implemented. If not each time a new user is
     added to the group, all the users should be sent in the PUT request.

*  Renewed support for bearer type SAML 2.0 token

Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
----------------------------------------------------------

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration. 
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to 
secure them with default mode. 

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool 
	script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)  

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually 

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.  
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class. 

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files 
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory. 

2. Start server by running wso2server script from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password 
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key) 

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)
