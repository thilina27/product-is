<h1>@product.name@ : An Open Source Identity and Entitlement Management Server</h1>

<h3>@product.name@ v@product.version@ Release Note</h3>

<h3>@timestamp@</h3>

<p>
    The @product.name@ team is pleased to announce the release of version @product.version@ of
    the @product.name@ (IS).
</p>

<p>@product.name@ is an open source Identity and Entitlement management server. It supports a wide array of
    authentication
    protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive.
    It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound
    provisioning is
    supported through SCIM and SPML</p>

<p>
    @product.name@ is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.com/products/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a>,
    an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
    componentization.</p>

<p>All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.</p>

<p>
    You can download this distribution from <a href="http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/">
    http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/</a>.</p>

<p>The online documentation is available at
    <a href="http://docs.wso2.org/wiki/display/IS510/WSO2+Identity+Server+Documentation">
        http://docs.wso2.org/wiki/display/IS510/WSO2+Identity+Server+Documentation.</a></p>

<h2>How to Run </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Extract the downloaded zip</li>
    <li>Go to the bin directory in the extracted folder</li>
    <li>Run the wso2server.sh or wso2server.bat as appropriate</li>
    <li>If you need to start the OSGi console with the server use the property
        -DosgiConsole when starting the server. The INSTALL.txt file found on the
        installation directory will give you a comprehensive set of options and
        properties that can be passed into the startup script
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>New Features In This Release</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Merge multiple user profiles</li>

    <p>In cases where users will have multiple entries in their respective user stores, to avoid requiring multiple
        logins to an application to obtain a fully privileged view for a single user's details, we now support merging
        of multiple user profiles.</p>

    <li>Workflow Support for Identity Server</li>

    <p>WSO2 IS 5.1.0 now supports user store operations to engage with workflows. Administrators will be able select
        at which levels each operation should be approved before they get executed. This will be available as a
        optional feature where administrator will be able to select if to use them on their user store operations or not. </p>

    <li>XACML cache invalidation notification when changes are made to Identities</li>

    <p>@product.name@ is now able to send invalidation notifications to external endpoints when there is a change in user
        roles, permissions or attributes as well as clear the internal cache when user roles, permissions or attributes
        been updated</p>

    <li>PATCH operation support for SCIM 1.1</li>

    <p>PUT supports the replace operation but not the update operation. Since group is a heavy resource, the
       operation that alters without replacement (PATCH) needs to be implemented. If not each time a new user is
       added to the group, all the users should be sent in the PUT request.</p>

    <li>Renewed support for bearer type SAML 2.0 token</li>
</ul>
